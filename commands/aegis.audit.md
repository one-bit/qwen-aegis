description: Run a full or targeted AEGIS diagnostic audit on a codebase
argument-hint: "[path-to-repo]"
tools: [read_file, write_file, edit, run_shell_command, glob, grep_search, agent, ask_user_question]
---

<objective>
Initiates a new AEGIS diagnostic audit on a target codebase. This is the primary entry point for all Core audit operations. Guides the user through scope selection, domain targeting, tool configuration, and confirmation before delegating to the Phase 0 workflow.

If no `.aegis/` directory exists, delegates project initialization to `/aegis.init` before proceeding.
If an existing audit is detected, routes to `/aegis.resume` instead of starting fresh.

Produces: Phase 0 (Context & Threat Modeling) output, building on the `.aegis/` structure created by `/aegis.init`.

## Step 1: Determine Target Repository

Check if ${arguments} contains a repository path:
- If YES: use the provided path as the audit target
- If NO: use the current working directory

Validate the target:
- Confirm the path exists and is a directory
- Check for .git/ (warn if absent — not required but informative)
- Display target path for user confirmation

## Step 2: Ensure Project Initialized

Check if `.aegis/STATE.md` exists in the target repository:

- If YES (existing project): read_file STATE.md to determine status.
  - If status is "initialized" (init done but no audit started): proceed to Step 3
  - If status is "in_progress" or "paused": An audit is already in progress.
    ```
    ════════════════════════════════════════
    EXISTING AUDIT DETECTED
    ════════════════════════════════════════

    Target: [path]
    Current Phase: [from STATE.md]
    Status: [from STATE.md]
    Findings so far: [count]

    [1] Resume existing audit (recommended) → runs /aegis.resume
    [2] Start fresh (WARNING: archives existing .aegis/ state)
    [3] Cancel
    ════════════════════════════════════════
    ```
    - If [1]: delegate to /aegis.resume
    - If [2]: run /aegis.init logic (archives old .aegis/, creates fresh), then proceed to Step 3
    - If [3]: exit

- If NO (no .aegis/ directory): Project not yet initialized.
  - Run /aegis.init process to create .aegis/ with STATE.md, MANIFEST.md, and findings/
  - The init process handles: git repo validation, tool detection, .gitignore update
  - After init completes, proceed to Step 3

## Step 3: Repository Analysis

Analyze the target repository and display:
```
════════════════════════════════════════
TARGET REPOSITORY
════════════════════════════════════════

Path: [absolute path]
Languages: [detected from file extensions]
Frameworks: [detected from config files — package.json, requirements.txt, go.mod, etc.]
Repository size: [file count estimate]
Last commit: [if git repo — short hash + date]
════════════════════════════════════════
```

## Step 4: Select Audit Scope

Present audit scope options:
```
════════════════════════════════════════
AUDIT SCOPE
════════════════════════════════════════

[1] Full audit — all phases (0-5), all 14 domains (recommended for first run)
[2] Targeted audit — select specific domains to include
[3] Quick scan — Phases 0-2 only (context + signals + domain audits, no synthesis/adversarial)
[4] Cancel
════════════════════════════════════════
```

If [2] (Targeted) selected, present domain checklist:
```
Select domains to include:

[ ] 00 — Context & Intent
[ ] 01 — Architecture & System Design
[ ] 02 — Data & State Integrity
[ ] 03 — Correctness & Logic
[ ] 04 — Security
[ ] 05 — Compliance, Privacy & Governance
[ ] 06 — Testing Strategy & Verification
[ ] 07 — Reliability & Resilience
[ ] 08 — Scalability & Performance
[ ] 09 — Maintainability & Code Health
[ ] 10 — Operability & Developer Experience
[ ] 11 — Change Risk & Evolvability
[ ] 12 — Team, Ownership & Knowledge Risk
[ ] 13 — Risk Synthesis & Forecasting

Enter domain numbers (comma-separated), "all" for full audit, or "back" to return to scope selection:
```

Note: Domain 00 (Context) is always included regardless of selection — it is required for scope establishment.

## Step 5: Audit Configuration

Present optional configuration:
```
════════════════════════════════════════
AUDIT CONFIGURATION
════════════════════════════════════════

Tool selection (all enabled by default):
  [x] SonarQube — code quality, complexity, duplication
  [x] Semgrep — pattern-based security/correctness scanning
  [x] Trivy — vulnerability and misconfiguration scanning
  [x] Gitleaks — secrets detection
  [x] Checkov — infrastructure-as-code scanning
  [x] Syft + Grype — SBOM generation + CVE matching
  [x] git-history — churn, author concentration, change frequency

Toggle tools? Enter tool names to disable, "ok" to continue, or "back" to return to scope selection:
════════════════════════════════════════
```

If the target has no IaC files, note that Checkov will be skipped automatically.
If no .git/ directory, note that git-history and Gitleaks will have limited output.

## Step 6: Confirm and Execute

Display the audit plan for confirmation:
```
════════════════════════════════════════
AUDIT PLAN
════════════════════════════════════════

Target: [path]
Scope: [Full / Targeted / Quick]
Phases: [0-5 or 0-2]
Domains: [count] of 14 [list if targeted]
Tools: [count] enabled [list any disabled]
Estimated sessions: [count based on scope — full ~8-10, quick ~4-5]

[1] Start audit (recommended)
[2] Modify scope
[3] Cancel
════════════════════════════════════════
```

If [1] selected:
1. Update .aegis/STATE.md: set current phase to 0, overall status to "in_progress"
2. Record audit scope, domain selection, and tool configuration in .aegis/STATE.md
3. Update .aegis/STATE.md Session Tracking: set Started to current timestamp, Sessions to 1, Last session to current timestamp
4. Begin the phase execution loop (Step 7)

Note: .aegis/ directory, STATE.md, and MANIFEST.md were created by /aegis.init in Step 2.

If [2]: return to Step 4
If [3]: exit without creating any files

## Step 7: Phase Execution Loop

Execute audit phases sequentially with checkpoints between each phase:

```
For each phase in the audit scope (full: 0-5, quick: 0-2):

  1. Invoke the phase workflow:
     - Phase 0 → phase-0-context workflow
     - Phase 1 → phase-1-reconnaissance workflow
     - Phase 2 → phase-2-domain-audits workflow
     - Phase 3 → phase-3-cross-domain workflow
     - Phase 4 → phase-4-adversarial-review workflow
     - Phase 5 → phase-5-report workflow

  2. After phase workflow completes, invoke phase-checkpoint workflow:
     - Displays phase completion summary and cumulative progress
     - Previews the next phase
     - Offers: [1] Continue  [2] Pause  [3] Abort

  3. Based on user's checkpoint decision:
     - "Continue": proceed to next iteration of this loop
     - "Pause": stop loop — STATE.md updated with resume point, exit cleanly
     - "Abort": stop loop — STATE.md updated, exit cleanly

  4. If user paused or aborted: display resume instructions and stop execution
```

The final checkpoint (after Phase 5 or last phase in scope) displays "Core audit complete" with next steps (/aegis.report, /aegis.transform) instead of continue/pause/abort options.

Note: Each phase workflow internally handles session-handoff between agents. The checkpoint workflow operates at the phase boundary level, not the agent boundary level.
